The application can be run though the attached executable file on any system that can run .exe files.
No further libraries need to be isntalled ot run this, nor does python need to be installed on the device.
Of the devices tested on, some have flagged the file as a virus because it has no certificate.

According to VirusTotal, Antiy-AVL, Cylance, Gridinsoft, Jiangmin, Windows Defender, Yandex, and Zillya
detect the file as a virus, so if your system has one of these anti-virus installed, you will need to disable
it to run the executable.

Alternatively, the file can be run through the command line, but this will require external libraries to be
installed using the commands below.
