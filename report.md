# Constructing a Checkers Computer by Using the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

_Abstract:_ In this short paper, we will discuss the techniques involved in the construction of a functional checkers computer by creating a functional checkers player, and implementing an intelligent agent which uses the minimax algorithm to calculate optimal moves. The agent will play legal moves following the english draughts rules [1], have variable difficulty, and perform reasonably well.
